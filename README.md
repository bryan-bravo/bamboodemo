GeoCoding bamboo demo

REQUIREMENTS
Requirements for code sample: You would need to demonstrate some coding work.  We donâ€™t expect a ton of time invested in it (2 hrs max) to show how you integrate to an API (could be something as simple as a Google Maps API call to geo code an address) and then show how you handle the response and persist it to a DB.

DEMO
Deployed to Google API Engine
